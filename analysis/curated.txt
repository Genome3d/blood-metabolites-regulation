ALDH2	kynurenine	3-hydroxy-dl-kynurenine possible inhibitor of ALDH2	[27592281]
FNDC4	glucose/ mannose	FNDC4 administration ameliorated glucose intolerance and reduced HFD-induced body weight gain in mice	[29787756] 
GRM1	X-12798/ phenylalanine	L-Glutamate supplementation increased levels of mGluR1 (gene synonym) and phenylalanine [25368996]. Derivatives of phenylalanine possible antagonists of mGluR1 [8730745]]	[25368996, 8730745] 
HSP90AA1	asparagine	asparagine repeat rich peptides are crucial for the direct interaction between PfHsp70-x and human Hsp70-Hsp90 organizing protein (hHop) in vitro.	[30183110]
KLC1	asparagine	Based on these finding, we propose that N343 of KLC1 can form "a carboxylate clamp" with its neighboring asparagine to interact with JIP1, similar to that of HSP70/HSP90 organizing protein-1's (HOP1) interaction with heat shock proteins	[22470497]

PRKCD	phosphate/ erythronate	The activity of PKC delta for autophosphorylation with ATP is around 4 times that of the isoenzymes alpha, beta, gamma (cPKC), and with GTP it is around 24 times that of cPKC	[7826379]
PRMT7	lysine/ glutaroyl carnitine	Analysis of the specific methylation sites within intact histone H2B and within H2B and H4 peptides revealed novel post-translational modification sites and a unique specificity of PRMT7 for methylating arginine residues in lysine- and arginine-rich regions	[24247247]
RERE	X-11820/ cholesterol	Suggestive associations of RERE and circulating blood CD34(+), which is positively related to cholesterol levels.	[23287867]

UGT1A6	biliverdin	Variants in the UGT1A1 gene and its promoter are known to determine levels of unconjugated bilirubin (UCB), but do not explain all cases of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia	[22118420]
UGT1A7	biliverdin	Variants in the UGT1A1 gene and its promoter are known to determine levels of unconjugated bilirubin (UCB), but do not explain all cases of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia	[22118420]
